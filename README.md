# Fire Response Incident Flow

Welcome to the fire response incident flow project, powered by [crewAI](https://crewai.com). This project aims to assist the people involved during a fire crisis at the city of San Cristobal de la Laguna, Canary Islands, Spain.

## Installation

Ensure you have Python >=3.10 <=3.13 installed on your system. This project uses [UV](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) for dependency management and package handling, offering a seamless setup and execution experience.

First, if you haven't already, install uv:

```bash
pip install uv
```

Next, navigate to your project directory and install the dependencies:

(Optional) Lock the dependencies and install them by using the CLI command:

```bash
crewai install
```

## Running the Project

To kickstart your crew of AI agents and begin task execution, run this from the root folder of your project:

```bash
crewai run
```

## Limitations

The current project is not yet completed, only the basic structure of the project has been added. Therefore, the project at this moment is not able to predict any response.
